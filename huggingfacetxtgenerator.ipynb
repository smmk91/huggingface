              "'?\\n\\nMachine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.\\n\\nThe process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide.\\n\\nThe primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.\\n\\nWhat are the types of Machine Learning?\\n\\nThere are three types of machine learning:\\n\\n1. Supervised Learning:\\n\\nIn supervised learning, the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, known as training data, in learning function to predict an output from an input data.\\n\\nFor example, in a spam email filter, the email program is trained to distinguish spam emails from regular emails by learning from a set of emails that are already classified as spam and not spam.\\n\\n2. Unsupervised Learning:\\n\\nIn unsupervised learning, the computer is not told the correct answer; instead, it must find patterns and relationships in the data on its own.\\n\\nFor example, in customer segmentation, the computer learns to group customers into different segments based on their buying behavior without being explicitly told how to do so.\\n\\n3. Reinforcement Learning:\\n\\nReinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to achieve a goal. The agent is rewarded or penalized (with positive or negative rewards) for its actions, where the goal is to learn an optimal behavior, that is, a policy, that maximizes the total reward.\\n\\nFor example, in playing a game, the agent learns the optimal strategy to win the game by learning from the rewards and penalties it receives.\\n\\nWhat are the applications of Machine Learning?\\n\\nMachine learning has a wide range of applications in various fields, including:\\n\\n1. Healthcare:\\n\\nMachine learning is used for medical diagnosis, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. For example, machine learning algorithms can analyze medical images to detect diseases such as cancer.\\n\\n2. Finance:\\n\\nMachine learning is used for fraud detection, credit risk assessment, and algorithmic'"

We are given that the center of the circle is at (-2, 3), and the distance from the center to the point (x, y) is 5. So, we have the distance formula: sqrt[(x+2)^2 + (y-3)^2] = 5. Squaring both sides, we get:\\n\\nx^2 + 4x + 4 + y^2 - 6y + 9 = 25.\\n\\nRearranging the terms, we get the quadratic equation: x^2 + 4x - 6y + y^2 - 9 = 25. Since this is a circle, the coefficients of x and y must be equal in absolute value. This gives us the condition 4 = y, and the equation becomes x^2 + 4x - 6(4) + (4)^2 - 9 = 25, which simplifies to x^2 + 4x + 1 = 0. Factoring, we get (x+2)^2 = 0, so x = -2.\\n\\nNow, we can find y by substituting x = -2 into the original equation: (-2)^2 + y^2 = 25, which gives y^2 = 25 - 4 = 21, so y = sqrt(21).\\n\\nTherefore, the center of the circle is at (-2, 3), and a point on the circle is at (-2, sqrt(21)).\"}\n"
